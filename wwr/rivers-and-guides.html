                Located in the Sawtooth Mountains in central Idaho, the salmon river is a beautiful escape
                to bliss. While you may encounter class III to IV rapids, most beginners would be able
                to float no problem. For those of you who are more experienced, don't be dismayed, there are
                plenty of tough sections that can provide maximum rafting experience.

              <p class="river_description">
                This river includes CLASS III AND CLASS IV rapids, those who float
                should be in good physical condition.
                This river is long enough, and with adequate resources, to float for multiple days.

                Nestled inside the most breathtaking National Park in the United States, the colorado river offers a
                phenomenal rafting experience to all those who enter. These rapids are set apart from others as you should be
                an experienced whitewater rafter to participate. While the rapids may be tough, the views and experience will
                be one you will not soon forget!

                The Colorado River, inside the Grand Canyon, includes CLASS IV AND CLASS V rapids. Those who are inexperienced
                should not raft this area. The length of this river can provide up to 2 days of rafting, but 1 will be more than enough.
