        There is lots to do and see in Oregon, there are waterfalls all over the state, 
        and the coast is just a few miles away. On top of all of that with Oregon being 
        such a diverse place, there are all sorts of restaurants and life experiences 
        that you can have in the city. Along with the mountains and nature walks the beautiful 
        Columbia River is easily accessible and visible from the highway.

          Just a few hours drive away from the main house, the Oregon coast
          is an incredible place to visit. The water may not be warm, but the
          vast amount of coast and landscape makes great family photos. There
          are all kinds of rock formations, pretty hikes, and fun small towns
          to visit. Did I also mention that there is vertually NO polution? This
          means that the air on the coast is always fresh and clean.
