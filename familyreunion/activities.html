        There is lots to do and see in Oregon, there are waterfalls all over the state, 
        and the coast is just a few miles away. On top of all of that with Oregon being 
        such a diverse place, there are all sorts of restaurants and life experiences 
        that you can have in the city. Along with the mountains and nature walks the beautiful 
        Columbia River is easily accessible and visible from the highway.
