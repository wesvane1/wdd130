        We know that it is tough moving from one place to another, but we know firsthand 
        going on vacation once you have settled in a place can even be harder. Especially 
        with part of the family living in Alaska it can be a real trek getting up there 
        during a good time without many tourists. Alternatively, if everyone moves to the 
        same place then we won't have to travel as far to see one another. It would be tough 
        moving, but with many members of the family starting to settle it may be best to 
        settle in a place close to family.
