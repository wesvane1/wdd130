        We know that it is tough moving from one place to another, but we know firsthand 
        going on vacation once you have settled in a place can even be harder. Especially 
        with part of the family living in Alaska it can be a real trek getting up there 
        during a good time without many tourists. Alternatively, if everyone moves to the 
        same place then we won't have to travel as far to see one another. It would be tough 
        moving, but with many members of the family starting to settle it may be best to 
        settle in a place close to family.

          Wes: I love Oregon for the weather, and the family that resides there. Savanna and I were also married there, so it holds
          a special place in our hearts. The weather has a perfect balance of overcast days, as well as pretty sunshine days.
        </p>
        <p class="testimony">
          Savanna: I love Oregon because I spent every summer there growing up. I also love the trees all around. I know that there is always 
          a fun nature walk to go on and there is always a tasty new resturant to try.
        </p>
        <p class="testimony">
          Porter: I like Oregon because of the people. Also I have a ton of friends that live here.
        </p>
        <p class="testimony">
          Katie: I grew up in Oregon, so it's only natural that I ended up back here! I have always been impressed with the nursing community here,
          that is also a nice plus.
        </p>

          Why should you move here? I, and many others, find that the greater Portland area is one that is always 
          accomidating and comfortable for growth. Along with the vast
          variety of food and shops, the scenery here is breathtaking. Savanna and I are going to find ourselves moving 
          back to Oregon once we graduate
          and find online jobs. No questions asked! We hope that you may consider coming out here with us.
