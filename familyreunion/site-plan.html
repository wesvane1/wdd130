      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        My family will be getting together this coming Christmas from all around the country. While they live in pretty places
        such as Alaska, Northern Idaho, and Southern Utah my wife and I feel that we should all move to the same place. Oregon
        is about as in between as you can get from those 3 locations. It can also provided the residents the same type of weather
        that they would experience in their respective cities. There is much to do, and lots of family members who have permanently
        resided in Oregon for many years. It will not only bring us closer together with our grandparents, but it can give our parents
        a chance to watch our families grow, while in close proximity.

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page will contain easily accessible navigation, pictures from previous family reunions,
        the dates of the coming event, and the address of the main house that we will be staying at. 
        This site has two purposes, to help each family member know what we will be doing for the vacation. 
        It will also persuade them, or at least get them thinking about why Oregon would be such a great place to live.

      <h3>Activities</h3>
      <p>
        There is lots to do and see in Oregon, there are waterfalls all over the state, and the coast is just a few miles away. 
        On top of all of that with Oregon being such a diverse place, there are all sorts of restaurants and life experiences that you can have in the city. 
        Along with the mountains and nature walks the beautiful Columbia River is easily accessible and visible from the highway.
        This page will contain activities that we will be or can be participating in outside of the home, this will help eliminate empty plans. 
        This page will be constantly visited prior to the trip to allow the family members to familiarize themselves with what we will be doing. 
        This will help to eliminate any confusion about the activities, and also time wasted from making empty plans. An empty plan is any plan 
        made with the family where some of them are going to do one thing and some people are going to do something else. This is normally okay, 
        but everyone's voice should be heard about activities taking place.

      <h3>Testimonials</h3>
      <p>
        We know that it is tough moving from one place to another, but we know firsthand going on vacation once you have settled in a place can even 
        be harder. Especially with part of the family living in Alaska it can be a real trek getting up there during a good time without many tourists. 
        Alternatively, if everyone moves to the same place then we won't have to travel as far to see one another. It would be tough moving, but with 
        many members of the family starting to settle it may be best to settle in a place close to family.
        This page will contain the testimonials of both my wife and I as well as other permanent residents of Oregon. Many members of this family live 
        in Alaska, Idaho, Utah, and Oregon. We want to eventually move there and this page will help them understand why, and maybe will help sway them 
        to move there as well.
        Sure, there may be pretty places to visit in each state, but nothing is better than family being together.
